# AI & Data Analysis Camp with Samsung

This repository contains the materials and assignments completed during the AI & Data Analysis Camp organized by Misk Immersive Programs in collaboration with Samsung.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

1. `CRNN.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains code and explanations related to Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN), a type of deep learning model used for various tasks such as image recognition and time series analysis.

2. `synthesis data.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file focuses on data synthesis, which is the process of generating artificial data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data. This can be useful for tasks like data augmentation or testing machine learning models.

## About the Camp

The AI & Data Analysis Camp was a immersive program organized by Misk Immersive Programs in collaboration with Samsung. The camp aimed to provide participants with hands-on experience in the field of artificial intelligence and data analysis.

During the camp, participants learned about various AI and data analysis techniques, such as:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis
- Data visualization
